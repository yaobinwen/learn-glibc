# Learn `glibc`

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [glibc](https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the `glibc` package on Launchpad. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors and should be used under the same license. See [their license on Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/tree/LICENSES).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.
