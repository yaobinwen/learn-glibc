# Learn `glibc`

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [glibc](https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the `glibc` package on Launchpad. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors and should be used under the same license. See [their license on Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/tree/LICENSES).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.

## Versions

- `2.39-0ubuntu8.4`: The version used on Ubuntu 24.04, possibly **without** patches applied because I couldn't find the tag `applied/2.39-0ubuntu8.4`. Corresponding tag: [`import/2.39-0ubuntu8.4`](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/tree/?h=import/2.39-0ubuntu8.4).
